(CREATED ON: 06/03/2018.)

This file contains citations for all RFCs in numeric order.

RFC citations appear in this format:

  ####  Title of RFC.  Author 1, Author 2, Author 3.  Issue date.
        (Format: ASCII) (Obsoletes xxx) (Obsoleted by xxx) (Updates xxx)
        (Updated by xxx) (Also FYI ####) (Status: ssssss) (DOI: ddd)

or

  ####  Not Issued.

For example:

  1129 Internet Time Synchronization: The Network Time Protocol. D.L.
       Mills. October 1989. (Format: TXT=298, PS=551697, PDF=197036 bytes)
       (Also RFC1119) (Status: INFORMATIONAL) (DOI: 10.17487/RFC1129)

Key to citations:

#### is the RFC number.

Following the RFC number are the title, the author(s), and the
publication date of the RFC.  Each of these is terminated by a period.

Following the number are the title (terminated with a period), the
author, or list of authors (terminated with a period), and the date
(terminated with a period).

The format and length follow in parenthesis.  One or more of the
following alternative formats are listed:  ASCII text (TXT), PostScript
(PS), and/or Adobe (PDF).  Each format is followed by an equals sign
and the number of bytes for that version.  For example (Format:
TXT=aaaaa, PS=bbbbbb bytes) shows that the ASCII text version is aaaaa
bytes, and the PostScript version of the RFC is bbbbbb bytes.

Obsoletes xxxx refers to other RFCs that this one replaces;
Obsoleted by xxxx refers to RFCs that have replaced this one.
Updates xxxx refers to other RFCs that this one merely updates but
does not replace); Updated by xxxx refers to RFCs that have updated
(but not replaced) this one.  Generally, only immediately succeeding
and/or preceding RFCs are indicated, not the entire history of each
related earlier or later RFC in a related series.

The (Also FYI ##) or (Also STD ##) or (Also BCP ##) phrase gives the
equivalent FYI, STD, or BCP number if the RFC is also in those
document sub-series.  The Status field gives the document's
current status (see RFC 2026).  The (DOI ddd) field gives the
Digital Object Identifier.

RFCs may be obtained in a number of ways, using HTTP, FTP, or email.
